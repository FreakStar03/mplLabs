Aim: To implement of Multiplexer and Demultiplexer

* Multiplexer
In electronics, a multiplexer (or mux) is a device that selects one of several analog or digital input signals and forwards the selected input into a single line. A multiplexer of 2n inputs has n select lines, which are used to select which input line to send to the output.

* Demultiplex
The Demultiplexer is combinational logic circuit that performs the reverse operation of Multiplexer. It has only one input, n selectors and 2n outputs. Depending on the combination of the select lines, one of the outputs will be selected to take the state of the input.
