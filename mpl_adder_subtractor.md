Aim : To realize Half Adder, Full Adder and Half Subtractor

Theory:
Adders are digital circuits that carry out addition of numbers.

 1)Half Adder
Half adder is a combinational circuit that performs simple addition of two binary numbers.
Sum is done using XOR gate
Carry is done using AND gate

2)Full Adder
Full adder is a digital circuit used to calculate the sum of three binary bits.
Full adders are complex and difficult to implement when compared to half adders.

Substractor:
Subtractor circuits take two binary numbers as input and subtract one binary number input from the other binary number input.

1) Half Subtractor
The half-subtractor is a combinational circuit which is used to perform subtraction of two bits.
